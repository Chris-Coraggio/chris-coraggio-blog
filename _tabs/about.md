I'm an avid listener and a hearty laugher. If you take all you know about golden retrievers and project it onto me, you won't be too far off. My strongest departure from a sunny, smiley puppy is my intellectual journey, which began in the suburbs of Indiana and has led me to San Francisco today. The current state of my bedroom floor aside, I have a strong penchant for putting things in the right place - this fascination with logic and order has led me to grammar, language, music theory, mathematics, and software.

Off-screen, I play music, climb rocks, serve my church community, read books, and get around on $$ (\mathbb{N} \setminus \{4\}) $$ wheels. [Janae](https://janaecoraggio.com/) and I got married in 2024 and loving married life.

My hope for this blog is two-fold; first, that I have a workshop to chisel, mold, and craft good prose, and second, that you get a front-row seat to my mind. I welcome your feedback and thoughts.
